The property search app is designed to help users find properties efficiently. It likely includes features such as property listings, search filters (like location, price, and property type), user signup and login, and possibly even property details and images. The app might also handle user interactions, such as saving favorite properties and contacting property owners or agents. Additionally, it includes custom exception handling for signup errors and uses JUnit for unit testing to ensure the code works correctly. Overall, it's a comprehensive tool for simplifying the property search process.
